== Issues ==

 * Sort feature drop down to alphabetic order and fix the first letter to be uniform among features.

 * 3 different images (bin) to be added to image pop-up (.click() event).
 
 * Series count is not constant, ie. [1,3]

 * Time series should start from 1 for all selected features.

 * The statistics div might get more feature details and possible a histogram or a piechart.

Next skype call 3.8 Thu 2pm.
