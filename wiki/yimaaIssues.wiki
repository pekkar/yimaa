= Yeast Image Analysis =


== Issues ==

 * ~~Sort feature drop down to alphabetic order and fix the first letter to be uniform among features. ~~  
 => All are lowercase now

 * 3 different images (bin) to be added to image pop-up (.click() event).
 
 * Series count is not constant, ie. [1,3]

 * ~~Time series should start from 1 for all selected features.~~
 => Uses Highchart's own function now to detect the charts min and max values

 * The statistics div might get more feature details and possible a histogram or a piechart.

Next skype call 3.8 Thu 2pm.

=== todo ===

 * Ask Pekka which one to use: svn or git for code.google../p/yimaa?

 * 3D PCA plot / images
 
 * 20 different experiments (update the drop down dynamically) folder structure in the server 

 * Statistics layout

 * Possible new pulldown for charts involving multiple/groups of features
 * Remove tipsy from image scroll? (Duplicate information)
